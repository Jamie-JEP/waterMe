## Title
The app that helps you manage plants easily considering the characteristics of each plant.

## Abstract
Most people grow plants at home that provide air purification and psychological stability, along with the popularity of "Planterior" which combines interior design and plant cultivation. However, many people struggle to care for their plants properly, leading to a demand for smart plant systems. Our proposed solution is a detachable device that connects to sensors and a database to monitor and provide information on a plant's moisture, temperature, and light levels via a mobile application, helping users maintain healthy plants.
